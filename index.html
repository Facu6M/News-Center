    <p>Real Madrid was crowned champion of the Champions League after beating Liverpool 1-0 with a goal from Vinicius
With a solitary score from the Brazilian, the merengue team won the 14th title in this competition. <hr> Real Madrid beat Liverpool 1-0 at the Stade de France for the 2022 UEFA Champions League final and won the 14th title in this competition. Vinicius scored the only goal of the match after appearing at the far post after Federico Valverde kicked a wide ball.</p>
<p>After the match was over, the Real Madrid players hugged each other while the Liverpool players lay down on the field facing their defeat; other players from the English team, like Firmino, burst into tears.

With this new title, coach Carlo Ancelotti lifts his fourth Champions League: he won it with AC Milan (2003/2007) and with Real Madrid (2014/2022); this will be his second with the merengue team.</p>

<p>The start of the meeting was delayed by serious incidents in the entry of Liverpool fans: there were reports of false tickets, while supporters tried to sneak in by jumping fences. Due to the chaos, the final started half an hour later than originally scheduled.

Once the duel began, the English team was the clear dominator: they generated more approaches and had the most dangerous chances to open the scoring, but they always collided with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who showed off and saved Real Madrid (he blocked shots from before Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané).

For its part, the Merengue almost did not set foot in the rival area, but a goal was annulled towards the end of the first half. After 42 minutes, after an error between Alisson and Ibrahima Konaté and a rebound in Fabinho, Karim Benzema took advantage and sent the ball into the back of the net. The assistant annulled the goal for off side, which was later ratified with the VAR.</p>
<p>Merengue went ahead 13 minutes into the second half. Federico Valverde stepped on the area and shot on goal, and Vinicius Jr connected from below the goal to make it 1-0. Thus, Carlo Ancelotti's team, which had generated few dangerous situations, came out on top in the grand final. After the goal, the 'reds' had several chances to equalize, tried to react and went to the load to look for the tie. And he always collided with Courtois, the great figure of the game: he covered all the balls destined for goals in Liverpool's clear chances. Above all, several heads-up against Mohamed Salah, he had up to 5 spectacular stops that prevented the loss of the merengue team. </p>
